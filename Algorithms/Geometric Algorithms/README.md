# Mathematical Algorithms

## Implementations-

* **Line Intersection**

-To check if two lines intersect or not.

- O(1) implementation

* **Convex HUll- Jarvis**

-Given a set of points, find the set of points of the smallest convex
polygon that contains all the points of it.

- O(n^2) implementation

* **Convex Hull- Graham Scan**

-Given a set of points, find the set of points of the smallest convex
polygon that contains all the points of it.

- O(nlogn) implementation

* **Topological Sort**

-Given a Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG), find the linear ordering of vertices
such that for every directed edge u-v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

-Topological Sorting is mainly used for scheduling jobs from the given
dependencies among jobs.

- O(V+E) implementation (Same as DFS)
